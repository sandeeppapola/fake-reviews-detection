In this research paper, we explore the performance of various machine learning models for text classification.
The first step in the analysis involves preprocessing the text data, including tokenization, removing stop words, and applying other text cleaning techniques. The data is then transformed into numerical features using the Bag-of-Words approach and weighted using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scheme.

Next, we apply several machine learning algorithms to the transformed data and evaluate their prediction accuracy. The models considered in the study include Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forests Classifier, Support Vector Machines, and Multinomial Naive Bayes, Linearsvc, Sgdc.


Based on these findings, we conclude that both , Linearsvc (87%)and Support Vector Machines (88.1%)  demonstrate strong performance in classifying the text data accurately. 

Further research can be conducted to explore additional feature engineering techniques, model optimizations, and the incorporation of deep learning approaches such as neural networks to improve the prediction accuracy further.
